## What we've learned so far:
  
- Anything that can go wrong, will - usually in the worst possible way.
- Program complexity grows until it exceeds the capability of the programmer who must maintain it.
- Any given program, when running, is obsolete.
- If a program is useful, it will have to be changed.
- If a program is useless, it will have to be documented.
- The value of a program is inversely proportional to the weight of its output.
- Every non trivial program has at least one bug
  - Corollary 1 - A sufficient condition for program triviality is that it have no bugs.
  - Corollary 2 - At least one bug will be observed after the author leaves the organization.
- Bugs will appear in one part of a working program when another 'unrelated' part is modified.
- The subtlest bugs cause the greatest damage and problems.
  - Corollary - A subtle bug will modify storage thereby masquerading as some other problem.

### more smart quotes we totally relate to   
- Computers always start counting from zero, except sometimes.    
- The first 90 percent of the project takes 90 percent of the time, and the last 10 percent takes the other 90 percent of the time.  
- Computers are always right. Programmers are occasionally right.
- Any programming project that begins well ends badly. Any project that starts badly ends worse. 
- If a programming task looks easy, it's tough. If it looks tough, it's damn-well impossible.  
- There is always one more bug.
- If debugging is the process of removing bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in. 
- When a system is designed so that fools can use it, only fools can use it. 
- Everything depends. Nothing is always. Everything is sometimes.
- If you need to read a computer manual, you can't. If you can read a computer manual, you don't need to.
